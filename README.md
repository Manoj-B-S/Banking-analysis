📌 Objective
Provide insights into customer financial behavior

Identify high-value and at-risk customer segments

Support data-driven decision-making for product targeting and risk mitigation

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python (for data manipulation & modeling)

Jupyter Notebook (for exploration & documentation)

pandas, numpy (data handling)

matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)

scikit-learn (optional clustering/segmentation)

🔍 Steps
Data Loading & Cleaning

Import Banking.csv

Convert currency columns to numeric types

Handle missing values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Define "total wealth" as sum of deposits, savings, checking, and business lending

Visualize distributions (age, wealth, account types, etc.)

Analyze risk weighting by occupation, geography, etc.

Customer Segmentation (Optional)

Use clustering (e.g. k‑means) to group customers based on financial metrics

Insights & Reporting

Identify high-deposit clients and loyalty tiers

Explore relationships between account fees and loyalty

Highlight segments with elevated risk

📊 Sample Visualizations
